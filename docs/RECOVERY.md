# Keep the factory demo recoverable

**First, film the real factory demo.** No board has been flashed by this project.
The vendor factory recovery file is available locally after setup, and its SHA-256
has been checked. It may differ from the exact firmware shipped on your unit, so
make your own backup too. Neither recovery route has been physically tested here.

## Install the backup tools

The local `.venv` is already prepared. For a new checkout, use Python 3.12:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
```

If you use `uv`, `uv venv --python 3.12 .venv` followed by
`uv pip sync --python .venv/bin/python requirements.lock` is equivalent.

## Check and copy the board

Close serial monitors. Set the port to the one actually reported on your computer:

```sh
BOARD_PORT='/dev/cu.YOUR_ACTUAL_PORT'
.venv/bin/python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port "$BOARD_PORT" flash-id
.venv/bin/python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port "$BOARD_PORT" get-security-info
```

Confirm ESP32-S3 and **16 MB**. If the detected hardware differs, or security info
reports secure boot, encryption or disabled download/read access, stop and check
vendor recovery instructions. Do not use `--force` or change eFuses. Connecting
can reset the board; these commands do not write firmware.

For the identified, readable 16 MiB board:

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/backup_factory.py \
  --port "$BOARD_PORT" --bytes 16777216 \
  --board 'Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75' \
  --output backups/factory-first
```

The helper reads all flash twice, without running the factory app between reads.
It creates `VERIFIED.json` only when both full-size files have matching SHA-256
hashes. It never writes board flash and refuses to overwrite an existing backup
directory. Keep a second private copy of that directory. On failure, keep partial
files, power-cycle with BOOT released and diagnose before retrying into a new folder.

A flash dump may include device settings or credentials. `backups/`, `local/` and
`.bin` files are ignored by Git. Do not share the backup. It excludes eFuses,
external SD media and other chips.

## Restore your exact original demo

Use the **same board** and a verified backup. Close monitors, then explicitly run:

```sh
python3 tools/project.py restore --port "$BOARD_PORT"
```

The helper checks the saved size/hash, then writes the full image at address zero.
Esptool verifies the write. This replaces the installed eyes project and its flash
data. Power-cycle afterward and visually confirm the original demo. Flash copying
is not a general recovery guarantee for encrypted/protected devices.

## Vendor fallback

Setup downloads Waveshare's complete 16 MiB image to:

```text
local/recovery/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75-FactoryOnly-260805.bin
```

Its expected SHA-256 is:

```text
2b7e01ff1f37027385a3820e006f945464cfcee2a05954b3239cf75f250080b6
```

If your backup is unavailable and this is the confirmed board, check that hash
before writing the vendor image:

```sh
shasum -a 256 local/recovery/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75-FactoryOnly-260805.bin
.venv/bin/python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port "$BOARD_PORT" --baud 460800 \
  write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-size 16MB --flash-freq 80m 0x0 \
  local/recovery/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75-FactoryOnly-260805.bin
```

Use one complete image; do not mix bootloader/partition files from different builds.
If connection fails, hold BOOT while connecting USB, release, then re-list ports.
The vendor image is a fallback demo, not proof of an exact match to your original.
No full-flash erase is required for these normal writes.
